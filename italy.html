          <p> <strong>Italy</strong> officially the Italian Republic, is a member country of the European Union, whose form of government is a parliamentary republic. Its territory, with its capital in Rome, is divided into twenty regions, which in turn are made up of 110 provinces.</p>

        
          <p>It has been home to many European cultures such as the Nuraghic civilization, the Etruscans, the Greeks, the Romans and was also the cradle of Humanism and the Renaissance, which began in the region of Tuscany and soon spread throughout Europe. The capital of Italy, Rome, has for centuries been the political and cultural centre of Western civilisation. Moreover, it is the holy city for the Catholic Church, the Pope being the bishop of Rome and the micro-state of the Vatican being within the city. The cultural significance of the country is reflected in all its World Heritage Sites, as it has 55, the highest number of them in the world.</p>

                <p>Venice is a city located in the northeast of Italy. It is also the capital of the Veneto region and the province of Venice. Its historical centre, declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, is located on a group of islands in the Venice lagoon, in the northern part of the Adriatic Sea.

             <li><strong> Pisa:</strong> </li>
              <p>Pisa is a city in the Italian region of Tuscany, capital of the province of the same name. Among the city's most important monuments is the cathedral, built in marble between 1064 and 1118 in the Pisan Romanesque style, with its bronze portal by Bonanno Pisano and the pulpit by Giovanni Pisano. Next to the cathedral is the striking 12th century leaning tower, 58.36 metres high, which underwent its characteristic inclination immediately after construction began.
              </p>
              <p>Due to the nature of the terrain, there are two other leaning towers in Pisa: the bell tower of the Church of San Nicola at the opposite end of Via Santa Maria along the Lungarno; and the bell tower of the Church of San Michele degli Scalzi in the middle of the river promenade of the Piagge in the eastern part of the city (in this case the church is also leaning). The Palazzo Toscanini in "Lungarno Pacinotti" is also leaning.</p>
